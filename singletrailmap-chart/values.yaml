# Default values for singletrailmap umbrella chart.
# This chart is intended to aggregate multiple services. For now it ships with
# tileserver-gl as a dependency and we keep most defaults from that chart.
#
# You can override subchart values by nesting them under the subchart name.
# Reference: the tileserver-gl chart README/values at
# https://joe-akeem.github.io/tileserver-gl-helm-chart
#
# Example:
# tileserver-gl:
#   service:
#     type: LoadBalancer
#   persistence:
#     enabled: true
#     size: 10Gi
#   resources:
#     limits:
#       cpu: "500m"
#       memory: "1Gi"
#     requests:
#       cpu: "200m"
#       memory: "512Mi"

# Global values can be used by subcharts if they support them.
# These are placeholders for future umbrella-wide configuration.
